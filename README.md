# Parser to Parse SILAB Maps

NOTE: This code is not complete! Some manual adjustmenst might be needed.

SILAB maps consist of Courses and Area2 (-Edits). To retrieve all relevant lane structure data from the 
latter, one can use `parser\parse.py`, which writes them into a JSON file. 

Course parts and connections in between must manually be inserted.
